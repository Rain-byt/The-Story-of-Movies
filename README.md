Movie Analysis Project
Problem Statement

The Story of Film: This section aims at narrating the history, trivia and facts behind the world of cinema through the lens of data. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis is performed on Movie Metadata about Movie Revenues, Casts, Crews, Budgets, etc. through the years. Two predictive models are built to predict movie revenues and movie success. Through these models, we also aim at discovering what features have the most significant impact in determining revenue and success.


Approach

The problem was divided into several steps:

    Data Collection: Data was collected from the MovieLens website and through a script that queried for data from various TMDB Endpoints.
    Data Wrangling: The datasets were uploaded to a dataframe and explored. Null values were filled in wherever appropriate and polluted values were discarded or wrangled.
    EDA: Extensive data visualisation and summary statistics were used to extract insights and pattern from the various datasets. The history, facts and trivia behind movies were narrated through data.
    Machine Learning: Gradient Boosting Classifer and Regressor were trained on our feature engineered dataset to predict movie success and revenue respectively. Their feature importances were noted to gain insights into what factors influence the revenues of a movie relative to budget.
